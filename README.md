# Artemis Financial: Software Security and Vulnerability Assessment

## Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?  
Artemis Financial is a company that manages financial data and transactions securely for its clients. They wanted me to address security for their software and protect sensitive financial information from vulnerabilities. I needed to conduct a vulnerability assessment and improve the security of their software practices.

## What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?  
I think I did a good job of identifying key vulnerabilities like weak authentication mechanisms and insecure data handling. It’s important to code securely because it protects sensitive information and prevents attacks like data breaches. Strong security practices helps to build trust with clients and makes sure that the company avoids financial and reputational damage.

## Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?  
The most challenging part was testing for vulnerabilities without causing unintended issues in the code. I broke the code several times and had to debug it. It was also helpful because it gave me experience using tools like static analysis and secure coding techniques, which I hadn’t used before.

## How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?  
I increased layers of security by adding encryption and addressing insecure coding practices. In the future I might use tools like OWASP ZAP and dependency checkers to find vulnerabilities. I’d also use the mitigation techniques of deciding how severe the vulnerabilities are and the potential impact on the project of each one.  

---

## How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?  
I made sure the code was functional and by running it and checking after making changes. I scanned for vulnerabilities after adding code to make sure nothing new was introduced. This helped me make sure that the software was secure and still worked.  

---

## What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?  
I used resources like the OWASP Top Ten, static analysis tools, and code reviews. These will definitely be helpful in the future because they give me a structured way to identify and address vulnerabilities. Also following secure coding practices is something I’ll use in the future too.

## Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?  
I’d show employer my vulnerability assessment and how I addressed the issues I found. I think this shows that I can identify security risks and fix them. I’d also talk about how I used industry tools and best practices to improve the security.
